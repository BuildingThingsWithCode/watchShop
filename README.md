# A webshop portfolio project.  

Goal was to practice working with Spring and with a Postgres database. This project is hosted online.  
If you would like to try it out you can log in with the following credentials:  
user/user (user account)  
admin/admin (administrator account)

Note: This project is hosted on a free hosting service. Since free hosting has its limitations, you may 
occasionally notice slower response times.
